Domino Chain Validator

Given a 2D array representing a sequence of dominoes, determine whether it forms a valid chain.

    - Each element in the array represents a domino and will be an array of two numbers from 1 to 6, (inclusive).
    - For the chain to be valid, the second number of each domino must match the first number of the next domino.
    - The first number of the first domino and the last number of the last domino don't need to match anything.
